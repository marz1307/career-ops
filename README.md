## ✨ What you get

- 🔍 **Portal scanner** — LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, Welcome to the Jungle, Handshake, Reed UK, plus zero-cost ATS APIs (Greenhouse, Ashby, Lever, Workable)

- 📝 **Tailored CVs + cover letters** — archetype-driven, ATS-clean, one-page A4
- 🗂️ **Notion tracker auto-created** — full schema, three dashboard views (Pipeline kanban, By score, Active interviews)
- 🎯 **Interview prep** — STAR+R stories, company intel, JD-tailored question bank
- ⏰ **Scheduled scans** — pick a time of day, it runs itself
- 🛑 **Never auto-submits** — fills forms, drafts answers, stops at Submit

---

## 🚀 Quickstart

*For the full step-by-step walkthrough with every onboarding question explained, every daily-workflow mode, and a troubleshooting section, see **[MANUAL.md](MANUAL.md)**.*

### 1. Install

```bash
# macOS / Linux
git clone https://github.com/marz1307/career-ops ~/.claude/skills/career-ops
cd ~/.claude/skills/career-ops && npm install

# Windows (PowerShell)
git clone https://github.com/marz1307/career-ops $env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills\career-ops
cd $env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills\career-ops; npm install
```

That's it. The clone *is* the skill bundle — engine code, modes, templates, and node deps all live in `~/.claude/skills/career-ops/`.

### 2. Run

Pick any folder to be your **workspace** (where your CV, profile, applications tracker, and generated PDFs will live):

```bash
mkdir ~/career-ops-workspace
cd    ~/career-ops-workspace
claude
```

Then in the Claude Code chat:

```
/career-ops
```

### 3. Onboarding

The skill walks you through eight questions:

| # | Question | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Where's your CV? | Paste / file path / LinkedIn / draft from scratch |
| 2 | LinkedIn URL? | Goes in your profile |
| 3 | Portfolio / GitHub? | Optional |
| 4 | Target markets? | UK / EU / US / Remote (multi-select) |
| 5 | Target roles? | List them, or have the skill infer from your CV |
| 6 | Bright Data API key? | Powers LinkedIn / Indeed / Glassdoor scraping |
| 7 | Notion integration token? | Auto-creates your Applications database |
| 8 | Scheduled scan hour? | 07:00 / 12:30 / 18:00 / custom / off |

When you're done, your workspace contains `cv.md`, `config/profile.yml`, `portals.yml`, `modes/_profile.md`, `.env`, plus a fresh Notion DB with three dashboard views.

         │  apply (you click Submit)   │ ← Stage 4 (Applied)
         └─────────────────────────────┘
```

Beyond Stage 4 (assessment, phone screen, tech, onsite, offer) is tracked through `modes/response-tracker.md`.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- **Claude Code** — [claude.com/product/claude-code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code)
- **Node.js 18+**
- **Git**
- **Notion account** with an [internal integration token](https://www.notion.com/profile/integrations) (the skill walks you through it)
- **Bright Data account** *(optional)* — for LinkedIn / Indeed / Glassdoor scraping. Without it, the scanner falls back to free ATS endpoints.

## 🎛️ Customisation

Everything about you lives in user-layer files that **updates will never overwrite**. Ask Claude in-session to change anything:

| You say… | The skill edits… |
|---|---|
| "Change my target roles to Backend Engineer" | `config/profile.yml` + `modes/_profile.md` |
| "Add these companies to my portals" | `portals.yml` |
| "Adjust the scoring weights to prioritise remote" | `modes/_profile.md` |
| "Update my CV — I just shipped a new project" | `cv.md` + `article-digest.md` |
| "Tighten my seniority filter to mid-level only" | `modes/_profile.md` + `portals.yml` + `config/profile.yml` |

See [`docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md`](docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md) and [`DATA_CONTRACT.md`](DATA_CONTRACT.md) for the user-vs-system file boundary.

## 🤝 Ethical use

- **The agent never submits applications.** It fills forms, drafts answers, generates PDFs — but stops before Submit / Send / Apply. You make the final call.
- **Hard score floor** (default 70 / 100) sends low-fit rows to `Not pursuing` rather than drafting them. Override only with a specific reason.
- **Quality over speed.** A well-targeted application to 5 companies beats a generic blast to 50.
- **No impersonation.** The skill won't pretend to be you in live recruiter conversations.

## ❓ FAQ

**Do I need a Bright Data account?**
No — but without one, the scanner only hits free ATS endpoints (Greenhouse, Ashby, Lever, Workable). LinkedIn, Indeed, and Glassdoor coverage drops.

**Do I need a Notion account?**
Strongly recommended. The skill auto-creates an Applications database with three dashboard views. If you skip Notion, the tracker falls back to `data/applications.md` (local-only).

**Can I run this without Claude Code?**
The skill is built for Claude Code. Most `.mjs` scripts work standalone (`npm run scan`, `npm run pdf`), but the slash-command flow, mode routing, and onboarding require Claude Code.

**Will updates overwrite my CV / profile?**
No. The `DATA_CONTRACT.md` enforces a hard split — engine files in `~/.claude/skills/career-ops/`, your personal files in your workspace. Updates only touch the engine.

**Can I use this for non-tech roles?**
Yes. The archetypes in `modes/_profile.md` are user-editable. Tell the skill "change my archetypes to product management" and it rewrites the scoring weights, framing, and CV templates to match.

**Can I fork this for my own market / language?**
Absolutely. The default portals are UK + EU broad. Edit `portals.yml` for your market, and translate `modes/` if you want a non-English flow.

Built on Santiago Fernández de Valderrama's original [career-ops](https://github.com/santifer/career-ops) (MIT). The mode-routing system, the Playwright PDF pipeline, the TSV tracker discipline, and the ethical-use rules are his.

This marketplace build adds the Claude Code skill wrapper, Notion auto-creation, Glassdoor support, scheduled scans, the onboarding flow, and the engine-vs-workspace separation.
