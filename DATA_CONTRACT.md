# Data Contract

This document defines which files belong to the **system** (auto-updatable) and which belong to the **user** (never touched by updates).

## User Layer (NEVER auto-updated)

These files contain your personal data, customizations, and work product. Updates will NEVER modify them.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `cv.md` | Your CV in markdown |
| `config/profile.yml` | Your identity, targets, comp range |
| `modes/_profile.md` | Your archetypes, narrative, negotiation scripts |
| `article-digest.md` | Your proof points from portfolio |
| `interview-prep/story-bank.md` | Your accumulated STAR+R stories |
| `portals.yml` | Your customized company list |
| `data/applications.md` | Your application tracker |
| `data/pipeline.md` | Your URL inbox |
| `data/scan-history.tsv` | Your scan history |
| `data/follow-ups.md` | Your follow-up history |
| `writing-samples/*` | Your personal writing samples for style calibration (except `writing-samples/README.md`, which is system-owned documentation delivered by updates) |
| `reports/*` | Your evaluation reports |
| `output/*` | Your generated PDFs |
| `jds/*` | Your saved job descriptions |
| `data/routine-logs/*` | Headless `claude -p` routine logs (gitignored, machine-generated) |
| `data/wrapper-trace.log` | One-line-per-invocation trace from the scheduled-routine wrapper (gitignored) |
| `data/scan-failures.json` | Per-company consecutive-failure ledger for scripts/scan/scan.mjs stale-portal detection (gitignored) |
| `.env` | Local secrets — Notion token, Bright Data API key, etc. (gitignored) |

## System Layer (safe to auto-update)

These files contain system logic, scripts, templates, and instructions that improve with each release.

## The Rule

**If a file is in the User Layer, no update process may read, modify, or delete it.**

**If a file is in the System Layer, it can be safely replaced with the latest version from the upstream repo.**
